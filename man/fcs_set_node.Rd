\title{Define a Phenotypic Node by Boolean Gates}
\usage{
fcs_set_node(object, phenotype, tree_name = "tree1", node_name = "phenotype1")
}
\arguments{
\item{object}{An “fcs_gating_object” with completed gate_trees.}

\item{phenotype}{Character; expression like “A+B–C+…” where A,B,C are gate names.}

\item{tree_name}{Character; gating tree name (default “tree1”).}

\item{node_name}{Character; new node label (no “+”/“–” allowed).}
}
\value{
The updated “fcs_gating_object” with \code{gate_trees[[tree_name]][[node_name]]}
containing the composite mask and phenotype metadata.
}
\description{
Combines existing “+”/“–” gates in a tree into a composite phenotype node,
storing the logical AND of positive/negative masks.
